What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git hidden file gets created in that folder. We need it to enable us to use the git commands on this repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it is the snapshot that we want to be captured.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
